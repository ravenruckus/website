<h1>My Kids</h1>
<p>Two summers ago we moved from Utah to Seattle and lived in a 400 square foot studio for two months in Capitol Hill, along with our pet rats. Needless to say it was a pretty crazy time. This picture was taken a couple of months ago while we were  revisiting our old haunt, Six Arms in Capitol Hill, where we used to go for happy hour food, a cider for me and a chance to stretch our legs. On this last visit I was impressed by how much my kids had matured in the last two years. I didn't once have to yank them away from a dangerous on coming car. </p>

<h3>Conner</h3>
<p>Conner has played unified soccer for the special olympics two years in a row. Each time he has won bronze and this upsets him. He is such a fun kid. I'm very proud of him.</p>
