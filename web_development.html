<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>I used to think that creativity only came in forms like writing, drawing, and music. Once I started studying graphic design and coding alongside each other that changed.  At first it was obvious to me that learning how to bring shapes, lines and colors together into visually appealing and unique ways required a creative process. The further I’ve gotten into coding I’ve come to realize that not only is coding creative but that graphic design is a language. Both graphic design and coding seek to solve problems. Graphic design is often used to communicate by catching attention, making things clear, and being comfortable on our eyes. In web development it also needs to load fast, using as little space as possible. Plus it needs to be unique. </p>
 
<p>I find both exciting. Coding feels more active, like I’m trying to find an action to solve a problem in the most elegant way possible, taking up the least amount of space and time. Graphics feed my senses in a different way than coding does almost like I’m touching them even though the pixels remain on the screen. The most fun is bringing both of these languages together, which at first often feels clunky and awkward but the reward is high when you are able to figure out the pieces that slide together finishing the puzzle and making both jobs easier.</p>
 
<p>For example last summer I worked on teaching myself D3.js. I came to a point where I was tempted to make my own svg axis instead of using D3’s because I thought I would be able to customize it better. I quickly realized that I would have to do all of the simple math calculations by hand and even though that might be easily doable and maybe even a little fun I was running out of time. I went back to my JavaScript code and saw that with a simple loop I would be able to get a lot of what I wanted. That’s when it all came together css, svg, and d3, which also brings together the data I collected using python. Since then I’ve realized that the whole point of D3 is to not use loops. Plus somehow I broke my python environment. I’m pretty much cracking up as I write this. </p>
 
<p>Fitness, self-defense and martial arts can be like this. I used to work out in the gym, which was fine but over the last year after deciding to take a karate class with my kids I’ve been exposed to, in addition to karate; CrossFit, Maui Thai, and Jiu Jitsu. </p>
 
<p>This summer because I was already spending a lot of time with my kids during the day I decided that in the evenings while my kids worked toward their karate belts I would take Maui Thai, a class that I had been eyeballing from the other room for a few months. It was a lot of fun and gave me a more rigorous workout which I had been craving.</p>
 
<p>After my kids returned to school I went back to karate class with them. I noticed that I was having a lot more fun punching and kicking and getting more of a work out than I had in the class before I took Maui Thai. Hyper focusing on kicking and boxing for a few months really improved my karate skills.  On top of that we were working on a self-defense technique that I had worked on the previous year and even though I needed to improve I was able to help other people with their technique because it was finally clicking for me. It felt like a hugely successful class because I was able to see how far I had come, finally. Earlier in that day during CrossFit I had a similar experience where I was for the first time able to complete the full wod workout without making any modifications.  I was able to do this partly out of luck because it focused more on my strengths but also because I had come closer to mastering certain techniques and had gotten stronger. However, the next morning when I went to Maui Thai class instead of getting the intense workout that I had become used to I got a highly technical lesson that left me feeling like I’m certainly not the smartest person on the block. I pretty much still feel this way every time I go to Maui Thai class. </p>
 
<p>This process reminds me of learning to code. When I first start out in a new language I start very simply and basic trying to get an idea of the language but quickly jump to more complex code in an effort to solve a problem that has caught my interest. Jumping into it like this can feel a lot like how that Maui Thai class felt. Earlier in my quest for learning I would have felt much more discouraged. I would have left that Maui Thai class possibly seriously pondering the idea of never going back but I know how this learning process works now. After the class even though I was a bit discouraged I could feel my brain working on the new foot work and engraining into my muscle memory the important lesson of the pivoting foot, one of the harder lessons for me to get right. I know that when I’m able to bring these lessons together in a more confident way not only will I be getting a good workout I will be having more fun doing it while gaining an important skill.  And so it has been with D3.js. It would have been much easier to display my  data with a prepackaged program, and it would have been much easier to go the gym to get my workout, but D3 brings all of my skills together into one spot and opens up the door to greater creativity, originality, and flexibility. </p>
 
<p>I’m very excited to be at Galvanize. Not only am I reintroducing myself into the adult working world after 16 years I feel like by the time this program is over I will finally feel confident enough in my web development skills, a field that I have come to truly love. </p>
